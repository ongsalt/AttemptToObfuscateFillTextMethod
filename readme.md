# AttemptToObfuscateFillTextMethod
The server there is only to run wordcut npm package as I don't know where to find better thai word splitting library in javascript.

# How to use
Clone this project first.
If you want to start simple word splitting api then run `npm install` and then `npm start` and then go to [localhost:6969](localhost:6969).
If not just go into client folder and rewrite wordcut function to return some string then just open the index.html file in your browser.

# Why this thing is trash
cuz I just realized that there is `Object.freeze` method
